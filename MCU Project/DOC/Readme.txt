Final Project - MIPS based MCU architecture
This project aim is to design MIPS CPU core with Memory Mapped I/O and Interrupt capability 

## MCU (`MCU.vhd`)
Microcontroller unit. 

BTIMER (BasicTimer.vhd)

The Basic Timer is a dedicated hardware block found in most microcontrollers. Its primary role is straightforward – counting (either upwards or downwards, depending on configuration).
For example, an 8-bit timer will count from 0 up to 255. Once it reaches its maximum, the counter will wrap around and restart from 0.
Typically, timers can be configured through special function registers inside the microcontroller. For instance, instead of rolling over at 255, you might set the timer to reset once it reaches 100. Furthermore, timers are often connected to other hardware resources inside the MCU – for example, automatically toggling an output pin when the timer overflows.
Common timer features include:
Output Compare (OC): change the state of a pin when the timer matches a specific value.
Input Capture (IC): measure how many timer ticks occur between external events.
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM): drive a pin at specific on/off intervals by toggling it at both a match value and on overflow. By adjusting the duty cycle, you can effectively control the amount of power delivered to another device.
We’ll explore these advanced hardware functions in detail later.
For now, we’ll focus on using a timer for time measurement between events (e.g., execution time) as well as for generating basic interrupts.
In our design, the timer is configured to count upwards and to use Output Compare mode with continuous operation.

GPIO (GPIO.vhd)
The General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) block provides a simple way to interact with the MCU through external devices such as LEDs, switches, and push buttons. It serves as the bridge between the microcontroller and the physical user interface.
Data transfer to and from the GPIO is handled through the system’s BUS lines, allowing both read and write operations as required by the application.
Additionally, the GPIO can be configured to generate interrupts – for example, pressing a button may trigger an interrupt request (IRQ), which the MCU responds to by executing an Interrupt Service Routine (ISR).
This makes the GPIO a flexible module for handling both basic input/output functionality and user-driven events

Interrupt Controller (InterruptController.vhd)
The Interrupt Controller provides support for handling external interrupts generated by hardware peripherals connected to the MCU. These interrupts are managed and prioritized according to the order defined in the project specification.
An interrupt request occurs when a peripheral asserts an IRQ signal. However, the interrupt will only be serviced if the specific interrupt is enabled and no higher-priority interrupt is already in progress.
When an interrupt is accepted, the controller initiates the interrupt handling protocol: the pipeline is stalled, remaining instructions are completed, and the address of the corresponding ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) is placed on the BUS. The actual ISR address is retrieved from memory using the appropriate Mem[type] entry, after which the MCU performs a jump to that location.
Finally, an ACK signal is sent back to confirm that the interrupt request was received and is being serviced by the processor

OptAddrDecoder (OptAddrDecoder.vhd)
The Optional Address Decoder is responsible for mapping a given address to the correct hardware component within the system. Based on the address provided on the BUS, it generates the corresponding chip select signal that activates the relevant peripheral or memory block.
This ensures that only the targeted component responds to the transaction, allowing proper communication and avoiding conflicts between multiple devices connected to the system


OutputPeripheral (OutputPeripheral.vhd)
The Output Peripheral is the part of the GPIO system dedicated specifically to handling output operations.
Its role is to manage and drive the output signals (such as LEDs or other external devices) based on the values written to it through the BUS.
By separating input and output functionality within the GPIO components, this block ensures that all output-related actions are handled in an organized and efficient way.

InputPeripheral (InputPeripheral.vhd)
The Input Peripheral is the part of the GPIO system that manages input operations.
It is responsible for capturing and providing the values from external sources, such as switches, buttons, or other input devices, and making them available to the MCU through the BUS.
This separation of input and output responsibilities within the GPIO ensures clear functionality and simplifies interaction with external hardware.

7 Segment Decoder (SevenSegDecoder.vhd)
The Seven Segment Decoder is responsible for translating a given hexadecimal value into the correct segment combination required to display the corresponding digit or character on the 7-segment display of the DE10 board.
This allows numeric or simple alphanumeric data to be visually represented for debugging or user interaction

MIPS (MIPS.vhd)
The MIPS entity represents a single-cycle MIPS processor. In this architecture, all stages of instruction execution — fetch, decode, execute, memory access, and write-back — are performed within a single clock cycle.
The IFETCH unit retrieves the instruction from the instruction memory using the current PC value and determines the next PC based on sequential execution, jumps, or branches.
The IDECODE unit decodes the fetched instruction, extracts register addresses, reads data from the register file, and computes potential branch or jump targets.
The CONTROL unit generates the required control signals by interpreting the opcode and funct fields, ensuring the correct operation for each instruction type.
The ALU_CONTROL module translates control signals into the specific operation required by the ALU.
The EXECUTE stage performs arithmetic or logical computations through the ALU, including address calculation or data manipulation as required by the instruction.
The DMEMORY unit manages reading from and writing to the data memory (RAM), enabling load and store operations.
Finally, the results are written back into the register file when needed, completing the instruction in a single clock cycle.
